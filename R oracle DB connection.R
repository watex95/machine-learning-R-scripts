#A couple of comments about this code are in order:

#First, I don’t like the idea of having a password appear, unencrypted, in the R program. One possible solution is to prompt the user for the password before creating the connection:

pswd <- readline("Input Password: ")
channel <- odbcConnect("DATABASE", uid="USERNAME",  pwd=pswd)
