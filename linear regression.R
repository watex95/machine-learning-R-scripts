#Assume that our shuttle launch data is stored in a data frame named launch, the
#independent variable x is temperature, and the dependent variable y is distress_ct.
#We can then use R's cov() and var() functions to estimate b:

b <- cov(launch$temperature, launch$distress_ct) /var(launch$temperature)

#From here we can estimate a using the mean() function:
a <- mean(launch$distress_ct) - b * mean(launch$temperature)
a

#correlations
